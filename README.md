In this Jupyter Notebook I have analysed the dataset of the superstore to answer several questions. For example:
1. what is the best month for sales
2. which products are sold the most
3. which customer segment has received the most discounts
4. relationship between variables: a graphical representation of the relationship between the variables using a scatter plot.
5. Correlation between customer segment and quantity using a heatmap.
6. Total sales and profit per state.

## Context
With growing demands and cut-throat competitions in the market, a Superstore Giant is seeking knowledge in understanding what works best for them. They would like to understand which products, regions, categories and customer segments they should target or avoid.
